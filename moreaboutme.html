    <p>hello! there if you have opened this page,for sure you want to know more about me.
  <br>
  then here we go..<br>
  So, it starts from my school life I was not at all good at anything which would make my parents proud.<br>
  I was poor at studies,sports,cocuricular activies.I was very mischive boy who always bother his parents.<br>
  I have scored very poor marks in my tenth board which was around <em>74%</em>, which made my father sad .Due to which he cried a lot and my mother was also very sad due to me.<br>
  My school from where I had given my tenth board,even they where not taking my admission for 11th and 12th science stream.<br>
  due to that reason I have to change my school and taken admission in DAV Public school which cost more than my imagination.<br>
  At that time I saw that how much my parents are doing hard work for me to give me a stable life so that I can study tension free.<br>
  Then I have decided to make my parents proud so I worked hard and brought <strong>90%</strong> in 12th.<br>And during this two year time  I have seen my <strong>Entrepreneur</strong>
  side of me,who want to live diffent life at least not this <strong>rat race life</strong>.
  <br>
  And thats my life aim to become a <u>successfull Entrepreneur</u>. Another one is to buy lot of things for my family and help others nearby me.<br>
  Help poors and other capable people.My aim is to buy a <strong>lamborghini</strong> cars for me.Specially my favourite one <em>lamborghini aventador</em>,since it is sad to hear that it will discontinuted in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thats for now ....thanks a lot for reading this.
